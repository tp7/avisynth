`AviSynthTwoFiveSDK`_
=====================

This will list the main changes between 1.x, 2.0x and 2.5. Not all changes
are listed here, but the new methods can be found in the new avisynth.h.

-   See information on `WorkingWithPlanarImages`_.
-   The converted `TwoFiveInvert`_ plugin filter source it here.
-   The same algorithm demonstrating how to speed up the processing
    (using PLANAR_Y_ALIGNED, etc.) can be seen at `TwoFiveFastInvert`_ plugin
    source.
-   Pixel type has changed in AviSynth 2.5. See more in
    `AviSynthTwoFivePixelType`_.
-   For working with audio, see `AviSynthTwoFiveAudio`_.
