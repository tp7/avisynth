SDK History
===========

"Writing Avisynth plugins" article was written by Ben Rudiak-Gould (Avisynth
creator).

It is taken from AviSynth 1.0 documentation as was (2000) at
`<http://math.berkeley.edu/~benrg/avisynth-extensions.html>`_.
The current (November 2006) mirror is at :
`<http://www.neuron2.net/www.math.berkeley.edu/benrg/avisynth-extensions.html>`_


Preliminary version of AviSynth 2.0-2.5 FilterSDK documentation has been
created at 2003 as a section of AviSynth online (wiki) documentation at the
official AviSynth site `<http://www.avisynth.org>`_ (maintained by Richard Berg).

Developers:

Klaus Post 'sh0dan' (AviSynthTwoFiveAudio, AviSynthTwoFivePixelType,
AviSynthTwoFiveSDK, ChangeFrameSize, ColorSpaces, DataAlignment,
DataStorageInAviSynth, EnvInvoke, EnvSaveString, SimpleMmxOptimization,
TwoFiveInvert, TwoFiveFastInvert and some other wiki pages)

Wilbert Dijkhof 'Wilbert' ("CompilingAvisynth" and some other wiki pages).

Contributors:
Simon Walters 'SiWalters' (SimpleSample 1.0 to 1.7 wiki pages)

'trevlac' ("SimpleSampleClass" wiki page)

Avery Lee 'phaeron' (some texts in "AssemblerOptimizing" wiki pages, "as
freely available for any use")

Thanks to other Avisynth community people for wiki pages
improving/correction!

The package of off-line AviSynth external FilterSDK documentation version
2.5.7 was created at 2006 at sourceforge.net CVS for distribution with
AviSynth v2.5.7 installation.

Most documents were converted from wiki pages (some modifyed/updated). Some
new documents are added too.

Developers:

Alexander Balakhnin 'Fizick' (SDKNecessaries, SDKLicense, SDKHistory, wiki
pages converting/editing)

Ian Brabham 'IanB' (he promised to write something under GPL :)

Wilbert Dijkhof 'Wilbert' (at least he promised to edit "CompilingPlugins"
sometimes :)
