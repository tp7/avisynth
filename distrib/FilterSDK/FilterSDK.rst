`AviSynth FilterSDK`_
=====================

AviSynth external Filter SDK is a package for developers to create your own
filters (plugins) for AviSynth.

The package consists of:

-   this documentation files in HTML format;
-   the header file 'avisynth.h' (recent version) with all declarations
    to include in plugin source code;
-   SimpleSample plugin source codes;
-   may be some extra files in 'Extra' folder.

You must have some `necessary software.`_

`Bens AviSynth Docs`_ is the documentation written for AviSynth 1.0 by Ben
Rudiak-Gould, in its original form.

See more about the modifications for AviSynth 2.5 in the `AviSynth Two-Five
SDK`_.

Also, `Simple Sample`_ has some very simple examples covering development of
a filter that does virtually nothing through to one that draws a variable
sized square, in the middle of the screen, in all `Color Spaces`_.

One thing not covered in SimpleSample, is how to `Change Frame Size`_ in a
filter.

Also have a look at `Getting started with Audio`_.

See `Non-clip Sample`_ how to create runtime AviSynth functions.

There are several different Colorspaces in AviSynth. See more information
about `Color Spaces`_ and `Working With Images`_.

Read more about the `Internal Functions`_ in AviSynth.

You can also browse various topic on `Assembler Optimizing`_.

Once you've got the basics down on AVS development (Ben's text is quite
good), the `[SDK]`_ for VirtualDub is also a good read. Good news is you
won't have to worry about writing `[function pointers]`_ and `[raw Win32]`_;
meanwhile, Avery knows his stuff when it comes to video & CPU optimization
techniques, so you best pay attention.

Some video related ebooks (PDF) can be downloaded freely from `[Snell & Wilcox]`_.

Please read AviSynth `FilterSDK license`_ and `SDK History.`_

And welcome to `[AviSynth Development forum]`_!
