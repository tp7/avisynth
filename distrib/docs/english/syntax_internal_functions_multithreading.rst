AviSynth Syntax - Multithreading functions
------------------------------------------

-   GetMTMode   |   v2.60   |   GetMTMode(threads)
-   SetMTMode   |   v2.60   |   SetMTMode(mode, threads)

These functions enable AviSynth to use more than one thread when processing
filters. This is useful if you have more than one cpu/core or hyperthreading.
This feature is still experimental.

GetMTMode(bool threads):

If *threads* is set to true GetMTMode returns the number of threads used else
the current mode is returned (see below). Default value false.

SetMTMode(int mode, int threads):

Place this at the first line in the avs file to enable temporal (that is more
than one frame is processed at the same time) multithreading. Use it later in
the script to change the mode for the filters below it.

*mode*: There are 6 modes 1 to 6. Default value 2.

-   Mode 1 is the fastest but only works with a few filter.
-   Mode 2 should work with most filters but uses more memory.
-   Mode 3 should work with some of the filters that doesn't work with
    mode 2 but is slower.
-   Mode 4 is a combination of mode 2 and 3 and should work with even
    more filter but is both slower and uses more memory
-   Mode 5 is slowest but should work with all filters that doesn't
    require linear frameserving (that is the frames come in order (frame
    0,1,2 ... last).
-   Mode 6 is a modified mode 5 that might be slightly faster.

*threads*: Number of threads to use. Set to 0 to set it to the number of
processors available. It is not possible to change the number of threads
other than in the first SetMTMode. Default value 0.

**Example:**

::SetMTMode(2,0)                      # enables multithreading using thread =
to
   # the number of available
                                        processors and mode 2
    `LoadPlugin`_("...\LoadPluginEX.dll")  # needed to load avisynth 2.0
    plugins
    LoadPlugin("...\DustV5.dll")        # Loads Pixiedust
    `Import`_("limitedsharpen.avs")
    src = `AviSource`_("test.avi")
    SetMTMode(5)                        # change the mode to 5 for the
    lines below
    src = src.`ConvertToYUY2`_.PixieDust() # Pixiedust needs mode 5 to
    function.
    SetMTMode(2)                        # change the mode back to 2
    src.LimitedSharpen()                # because LimitedSharpen works
    well with mode 2
    # display mode and number of threads in use
    `Subtitle`_("Number of threads used: " + `String`_(GetMTMode(true))
     \ + " Current MT Mode: " + String(GetMTMode()))
