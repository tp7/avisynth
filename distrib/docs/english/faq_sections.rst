General information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`This section`_ contains some general information about AviSynth. It's about
its history, the different versions floating around. It explains how to get
it to work, how to create a script and how to use plugins. It also discusses
some command line utilities and graphical user interfaces which are able to
open AviSynth scripts.


Loading clips (video, audio and images) into AviSynth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`This section`_ explains how to import the most common media formats (video,
audio and images) into AviSynth. It explains which internal filters or
external plugins can be used to import them and how this should be done. If
this section doesn't provide enough information to load your media format,
you should read the following document: `Importing_media`_. It discusses many
media formats, and gives a systematic way (using multiple ways) of loading
these formats into AviSynth.


Opening scripts in encoder and player applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`This section`_ describes frameserving and how to frameserve from and to
AviSynth. It explains how to load AviSynth scripts in supported encoders and
players, and what you can do if they don't support AviSynth scripts.


Some common error messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`This section`_ describes some common error messages and explains what to do
about them.


Recognizing and processing different types of content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`This section`_ explains what you should do when the video and audio in your
final encoding is not in sync. It discusses variable framerate video. It
explains how to recognize and process progressive, interlaced, telecined,
hybrid and blended content.


The color format YV12 and related processing and encoding issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`This section`_ contains specific information about the color format YV12 and
related processing and encoding issues.


How to use VirtualDub's plugins in AviSynth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`This section`_ explains how to use plugins written for VirtualDub in
AviSynth.
