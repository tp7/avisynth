* Added MMX optimizations to Overlay mode lighten+darken with opacity=1.0,
with no mask.
* Added SSE float to int audioconversion.
* Added 3DNOW! optimizations to sample-type conversions int to float, and
float to int. Much faster.

* Added RGB24, YUY2 and YV12 MMX Invert() function.
* Added MMX/ISSE chroma convertion to Overlay with YV12 input.
* Added MMX function for Overlay(mode="blend"), when a mask is used and
opacity = 1.0.
* Removed unneeded DevIL components


Changes
~~~~~~~

* TCPDeliver: Simplification and cleanup. Planar pitches handled more
consistently.
* DirectShowSource now requests interlaced material to avoid internal
(crappy) WMV9 deinterlacer. (Thanks to Russel Lang)
* ImageReader/ImageSource now accepts relative paths in all configurations.
* Adjust audio length in SelectRangeEvery to match new video length.
* Updated installer.
* ImageReader: tweaked default parameters.
* ImageReader: made ColorBars parameters optional (like docs claim!)
* ImageReader: No more "Image not in range". First frame is ALWAYS frame 0.
* Updated SoftWire codegenerator to latest version.
* ImageReader: Static image support, Floating-point FPS, aliased to
ImageSource, frames automatically flipped when necessary.
* ImageWriter: Optional "info" parameter to show filename.
* ImageReader / ImageWriter: All errors returned as text clips.
* AviSynth will longer resize to non-mod4 widths in YV12 mode!
* Dissolve can now handle audio input with different sample types.
* Dissolve now checks if samplerates are the same.
* Trim/Dissolve: Better error reporting.
* Updated DevIL libs; removed unneeded !DevIL components; improved error
reporting in ImageReader / ImageWriter.

no more!
* DirectShowSource() is now a plugin, and is automatically placed in the
plugin directory by the installer.
* Disabled avisynth_c plugin autoloading (no longer a compatible way to do
so).
* FrameRate() now calcs as (double)numerator/(double)denominator. (still
returns a float)


Changes from 2.53
-----------------


Additions
~~~~~~~~~~

* Added ConditionalReader(). This enables users to load per frame settings
into variables accessible to conditional variables.
* Added "Hardlight", "SoftLight", "Difference" and "Exclusion" as Overlay
blend modes.
* Added mode="chroma", "luma", "lighten", "darken" to Overlay.
* Overlay() now accepts RGB24/32 output.
* Added "pc_range=true/false" parameter to overlay(). This will make all
RGB<->YUV conversions inside Overlay assume [0->255] YUV range, and not CCIR
601 [16->235] range. Default is false.
* Added RGB input conversion to overlay.
* ShowAlpha now returns RGB, YUY2, or YV12 via the pixel_type argument. The
latter two can be used to layer an RGB clip with alpha transparency data onto
a YUV clip using the 3-argument form of Overlay().
* Added Overlay() for doing advanced video overlays/layers.
* Added SuperEQ(). SuperEQ is a very precise 16 band equalizer.
* Added IsYUV(clip) to script (it was only present in the documentation).
(Party Time)
* Added internal audiocache by [WarpEnterprises]. Added automatically by the
filters that need it.
* Added fast=true/false mode to SSRC. This will use a faster mode for
resampling. Default is false.
* Added Histogram(mode="stereo") shows a clasic stereo graph (I guess) from
the audio in the clip. Some may know these from recording studios. Quite nice
actually.
* Added Histogram(mode="stereooverlay"). Draws the stereograph on top of the
original image. YV12 only.
* Added ChangeFPS(linear=true/false). This will make AviSynth request frames
in a linear fashion, when skipping frames. Default:true.
* Added SSRC(int samplerate) SSRC resampling. Note that it only downsamples.
Audio is always converted to float.
* Added Tone(float length, float frequency, int samplerate, int channels,
string type). This will generate sound.

-   Length is in seconds. Type can be "Silence", "Sine" (default),
    "Noise", "Square", "Triangle" or "Sawtooth".
-   Defaults are Tone(10.0, 440, 48000, 2, "sine").


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed out-of-bounds read in Normalize.
* Fixed compiler warnings in avisynth_c
* Fixed very small sample corruption in SSRC.

* Fixed UnalignedSplice if only audio was present.
* Fixed Trim crash, if only audio was present (throws an error).
* Fixed slowdown on multiple Directshow Sources.
* Fixed green bars in small video with mode="levels" and mode="color". For
Histogram


Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Internal audio cache now has better efficiency.
* Optimization: MMX in Dissolve.
Changes
~~~~~~~~

* Added Kevin Atkinsons avisynth_c 0.20 (stdcall) API.
* Updated installer. Removed the old one.

you are doing a big samplerate adjustment (not just 48000 -> 44100).
* Updated installer. (Thanks to V_ICE for inspiration).
* Re-Added German documentation.
* EMMS is now executed between all filters to avoid potential FPU-states to
be carried from one filter to the next.
* Reimplemented SSRC. It is now capable of running multiple instances, it has
been better tested (occational strange sample should be eliminated). This
version support both upsampling and downsampling with very high precision.
* If any filter should request audio that is out of bounds, if will no longer
be passed to the filter above, but the invalid parts will be filled with
silence.
* Documentation restructured and much has been updated.
* Added C-versions of conditional planedifference filters, for non-ISSE
machines (not well tested though).
Changes from 2.52
------------------


Additions
~~~~~~~~~~

* Added audio support to DirectShowSource.
* Added seeking support to DirectShowSource.
* Added .GRF file loading to load filter graphs from GraphEdit. Be sure there
is an open pin, to which AviSynth is able to connect, otherwise expect "the
filter graph won't talk to me".
* Added optional coring=true/false to Levels and Tweak. both true by default,
as previously.
* German documentation.
* Added DV type 1 video input, using AviSource(). Video only!
* DirectShowSource() is now capable of properly opening audio with more than
2 channels. Tested with AC3Filter.

* Added default parameters to ColorBars.
* Extensive updates of German documentation.
* DirectShowSource capable of opening audio only. WAV/AC3/MP3 can be opened
using DirectshowSource.

they aren't already. Alignement is 16 for SSE2 machines, 8 for others.
* Added "Overall PSNR for Compare()" - thanks to temporance.
* ResampleAudio now accepts any number of channels.
* Added "after_frame=true/false" option to FrameEvaluate. This determines if
the script should be evaluated before (default operation) or after the frame
has been fetched from the filters above.
Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed memory leak in Plugin name export.
* Incorporated file lock fix in AviSource by WarpEnterprises.
* Minor fixes to field information in Info().
* Fixed occational hang in DirectShowSource (this might lead to leaks on
unload/load!)
* Fixed crashbug in Compare, when logfile was specified.
* Fixed distortion on Crop(align=true).
* Fixed overflow in ResampleAudio (Thanks to IanB!). [Bug 770853].
* Fixed Mergechannel broken with more than 2 channels.
* Made adjustments for longer sample support in ResampleAudio.
* Fixed crash in ResampleAudio, if no audio was present.
* Fixed crash in MonoToStereo().

* (Hopefully) fixed precision in PointResize.
Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added heavily optimized memory copy mode, that will be used in some blits.

only unrolls if 1) Athlon 2) Source width < 512.
Changes
~~~~~~~~

* Further clarification in Info() regarding field information.
* Minor changes to Limiter code (block prefetch).
* ApplyRange now accepts startframe = stopframe. This will only process the
specified frame.
* ApplyRange now supports audio and processes it to the end of stopframe.
* Updated avisynth_c API to v0.14.
* Reenabled function name export for VDubMod syntax highlighting - I'm not
sure if it had much effect on stability.
* Corrected ParseMultiplication so it parses from left to right.
* The default luma range in Limiter is corrected to 16-235 (it was 16-236).
* Temporarily disabled plugin function export for VDubMod. I'm suspecting
this of the "crash+disappear" of VdubMod.
* Removed HSIAdjust().
* Removed ffvfw from installation.
* ShowSMPTE does no longer require fps parameter - only if the current fps
cannot be used.

Changes from 2.51 beta
-----------------------


Additions
~~~~~~~~~~

* Added light version of "ffvfw" to the installer. No "Cannot locate
decompressor (YV12)" messages.
* Added ConditionalFilter, that returns one of two sources based on an
expression.
* Added conditional filters:
** AverageLuma(), AverageChromaU(), AverageChromaV() functions. ''Returns a
float from 0 to 255 based on the average pixel values of a plane.''
** YDifferenceFromPrevious(), UDifferenceFromPrevious(),
VDifferenceFromPrevious() and YDifferenceToNext(), UDifferenceToNext(),
VDifferenceToNext()'''.
** LumaDifference(clip,clip), ChromaUDifference(clip,clip),
ChromaUDifference(clip,clip). ''They return a float value between 0 and 255
of the absolute difference.''
** RGBDifference(clip1,clip2), RGBDifferenceFromPrevious(clip),
RGBDifferenceToNext(clip).
** YPlaneMax(clip, float threshold), YPlaneMin(clip, float threshold),
YPlaneMedian(clip), YPlaneMinMaxDifference(clip, float threshold).
''Threshold is a percentage, on how many percent of the pixels are allowed
above or below minimum. The threshold is optional and defaults to 0. There
are similar funtions for U and V.''
* Added ScriptClip(clip, string function, [show=true/false]). This will
return the clip returned by the function evaluated on every frame.
* Added FrameEvaluate(clip, script) - Similar to ScriptClip, except the
output of the filter is ignored. This can be used for assigning variables,
etc.
* YV12 <-> RGB conversions now use an intermediate YUY2 conversion to achieve
better chroma upsamplig. As a result of this ConvertToRGB now also take an
"interlaced=true/false" parameter.
* Added ImageWriter.
* Added "show" parameter to ConditionalFilter. This will overlay the results
on the screen.
* Added dynamic compiled limiter.
* Implemented Belgabors patch for exporting plugin functions.
* Build date is now (semi)automatically updated in version.
* Added script functions: IsYV12(clip), IsPlanar(clip), IsInterleaved(clip)

* AviSynth now mimics VDubs way of handling dropped frames to avoid problems
with buggy codecs.
* Trim now returns (x-1) frames as supposed.
* Fixed stereo setting in BlankClip
Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added MMX RGB24->YUY2 conversion.
* Minor changes to existing RGB32 -> YUY2 MMX.
* Minor speedup to ISSE limiter.
* Added SoftWire dynamic compiled horizontal resizer. Approximately 10-15%
faster - maybe even more on P4.
Changes
~~~~~~~~

* AviSynth will now attempt to deallocate framebuffers, if memory usage is
25% above default values or SetMemoryMax().
* Improved rounding precision in ISSE YV12 <-> YUY2 conversions.
* Improved chroma upsampling quality in planar YV12 -> YUY2.
* Better chroma alignment on interlaced YUY2 ->YV12.
* Slightly better precision in audio conversion.
* ApplyRange now checks if size and colorspace are the same.

the CPU register settings. (Especially Delphi-based apps).
Changes from 2.50 beta
-----------------------


Additions
~~~~~~~~~~

* Added start/end parameters to ImageWriter.
* Added Chr, Time and Spline script functions.
* Added ISSE and MMX YUY2->YV12 conversions. Faster than XviD - and both
interlaced and noninterlaced modes supported. Use
ConvertToYV12(interlaced=true).
* Added rewritten YV12->YUY2 (progressive) conversion to avoid using buggy
XviD conversion. It also has better quality as it properly interpolates
chromas as opposed to simply copying it. Speed should be the same. Use
ConvertToYUY2(interlaced=true).
* Added TurnLeft /TurnRight.
* YToUV() now takes an optional third parameter, that contains luma for the
final clip.
* AudioLength() now returns the size in samples (do however beware of
overflows on very long clips)

* Fixed wrong pitch being used in Temporalsoften scenechange - could in rare
cases lead to unexpected results.
* Fixed rounding in some cases in Temporalsoften.
* Doesn't add audio to track, if there is no present in AssumeSampleRate().
* Fixed isBFF() and isTFF().
Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Put in Steady's new BitBlt code, and enabled it for ISSE capable
processors.
* Much "conservative" code removed. A general speedup should be expected.
* Made SwapUV faster.
Changes
~~~~~~~~

* Removed all fieldbased/mod 4 checks.
* Restored how fieldbased/framebased works.
* Removed startup Box from installer.
* Greyscale inserts value 128, instead of 127. Some users have reported a
greenish tint.

-   Multiple audiochannels. Unlimited number of channels is now
    supported.
-   Float samples support. AviSynth is now capable of processing samples
    as floats.
-   Automatic sample conversion. If some filters doesn't support a
    specific sample type, they are converted to the format preserving most
    quality (most often floats).
-   Optimizations. Many basic features has been optimized, and now
    performs much better than previous versions.
-   Temporalsoften has a significant speed improvement, scenechange
    detection and a new improved blend mode.
-   Limiter can limit the YUV ranges, to avoid invalid color values and
    improve compression.
-   ColorYUV makes it possible to do very exact color corrections.
    ColorYUV has built-in auto-whitebalance and auto-gain features.
-   Select separate planes using UToY, VToY and merge them together
    again, using YToUV.
-   Fliphorizontal. implemented.
-   SelectRangeEvery is now part of the core functions.
-   Blur, Sharpen, Resize optimized.
-   Fast XviD colorspace conversions.
-   See clip info using the info() command.


Changes from 2.07
::::::::::::::::::

- Fixed crashbug in resize.
- AviSynth now only includes "*.avsi" from the plugin directory
- Changed maximum number of arguments from 40 to 1024.
- Resampleaudio() caused crashes, if no audio was present.
- Fixed: Exist() didn't work.
Changes from 2.06
::::::::::::::::::

- Script extensions:
``- - LeftStr(string, int size), RightStr(string, int size), MidStr(string,
int first, int length), FindStr(string, string), RevStr(string),
StrLen(string)``
``- - Sign(int), sign(float), Nop, Rand([int limit]), Select(index, item0
[,item1...]), Exist(string filename)``
``- - VersionNumber(), VersionString()``
``- - IsRGB24(clip), IsRGB32(clip), Int(float), Frac(float), Float(int),
Value(string), HexValue(string).``
- Strings can be compared using "<" ,">","<=",">=" operators (case
insensitive).
- Color option for Fades , Letterbox, and Addborders.
- Subtitle alignment and spacing options, added y=-1 centering support (x=-1
undocumented support remains) and defaults for x,y and align vary depending
on each other's settings.
- Optimization for recent BlankClip() RGB24 bug fix.
- Fixed ceil, floor and round functions.
- Fixed BlankClip RGB24 with odd widths.
- Fixed DB scale off by 2x in volume.
- Added FadeIn / FadeIn2 to fade in video and audio.
- Added AssumeSampleRate to change the samplerate without resampling (yes,
this will lead to desync!).
- Fixed one frame wrong offset in trim, when second argument is negative.
- Added abs(integer) and abs(float).
- Fixed '%' (mod) in scripts, so it returns absolute values.
- Added a boolean to DirectShowSource, so seeking can be manually disabled,
if it works very slowly.
- Added PointResize() function. Resamples as "Nearest Neighbour" in Virtual
Dub.
- Added SetWorkingDir() function.
- Fixed Normalize crashes.
- Added German documentation.

Changes from 2.05
::::::::::::::::::

- Fixed potential crashbug in Resize - real fix instead of previous hack.
- Default alignment is now 16 bytes, which should be faster on P4.
- Fixed bug in RGB32 greyscale, when with not divideable with 2.
- Added example scripts. - Added installer/uninstaller. No more need to
fiddle with .reg files and regedit.
- Fixed Trim, so negative values works as documented.
- Fixes to plugin autoloading: - freezed when invalid dll encountered, was
locking files unnecessarily, now also loads avisynth plugins with VDF
extension.
- Made forward seeking fallback code in DirectShowSource files - it will not
freeze anymore, just be very slow, since it has to decode all inbetween
frames!
- Added LanczosResize which uses the Lanczos3 algorithm - it provides better
quality than BicubicResize in many cases.
- Better rounding precision in BicubicResize/BilinearResize.
- Optimizations to YUY2 BicubicResize/BilinearResize.
- New ResetMask() filter: sets the mask to "all-opaque" (RGB32 only).
- ChangeFPS() now changes the framecount (thanks to Xesdeeni).
- AVI files, that contains an invalid first frame are now rejected - there is
no way of handling this situation gracefully. Segmented AVI's automatically
skip these segments, and will NOT return an error.
- Better parameter checks on Crop() and LetterBox().
- Fixed wrap at right side of picture in RGB
BicubicResize()/BilinearResize().
- Fixed another Chroma wrap issue in BicubicResize()
- Added optional pixel_type parameter to AVISource and siblings to force a
decompression format (YUY2, RGB32 or RGB24).
- Added optional left and right parameters to Letterbox - parameters are
placed after the existing to preserve compatibility.
- Added EnsureVBRMP3Sync(clip), to avoid desync of VBR-compressed
mp3-soundtrack. This will slow seeking down considerably, but is very useful
when using trim() for instance. Always use before trim().
- BugFix: Fixed crashbug in Resize functions on some machines.
- AviSource always returns last valid frame on decompression errors.
- Added check for invalid frame 0 (mostly seen in SegmentedAviSource()).

Changes from 2.04

- Avisynth now allocates minimum 16MB cache, or otherwise 1/4th of free
physical memory.
- Plugin autoloading (Create string regkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Avisynth\PluginDir) (still in alpha)
- Crash-on-exit bugfix in SegmentedAviSource.

stereo clip.
- MixAudio(clip_1,clip_2,float clip1_volume, float clip2_volume) Mixes two
audio sources together.
- Added ConvertBackToYUY2() That only uses chroma from the left pixel to
avoid shifting chroma color by multiple YUY2->RGB>YUY2 conversions.
ConvertToYUY2 remains unchanged.
- Added Documentation for new parameters
- Added sound to Loop() function.
- New function ConvertToMono(clip) - convert stereo to mono.
- New function KillAudio(clip) removes audio from clip. Use this if you get
crashes with compressed AVI sound.
- new filter: ColorKeyMask + bugfix in Layer
- New function Normalize(clip, float max_left, float max_right). Normalizes
audio. Both floats are optional. If maximum values (0 to 1) are used, the
stream will peak at this level, otherwise the peak will at full volume.
- TemporalSoften (MMX & C ) (previously released as plugin TemporalSoften2)
- MMX optimized HorizontalReduceBy2() in YUY2 mode.
- Corrected one pixel offset bug in VerticalReduceby2().
- MMX is now pixelperfect in compare with C implementations.
- Changed order in ReduceBy2() since VerticalReduceBy2 is faster.
- VerticalReduceBy2() has been MMX optimized. More than twice as fast. Filter
checks if image is too small to be reduced.
- Colorbars() now also generates a test tone. Test tone is a 440Hz sine at
48KHz, 16 bit, stereo. The tone pulses in the RIGHT speaker, being turned on
and off once every second.
- ResampleAudio() now skips conversion, if samplerate is already at the given
rate.
