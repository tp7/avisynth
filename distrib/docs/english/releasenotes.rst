Known problems and issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Rightclick on scripts to open them in VDubMod: When the script is
    messed up in the script editor, the correct error message does not
    appear.
-   Possible other bugs which are reported `sourceforge`_.


Future plans
~~~~~~~~~~~~


AviSynth v2.60:
:::::::::::::::

This version will be the next major version. Plugins for v2.5 will work in
v2.6. Most of the new code will be dormant inside 2.58 and with a minimal
surgical change a parallel 2.60 release will be made. This should allow easy
A-B testing for coding problems versus 2.6 interface problems. Design goals
and proposals can be found `here`_. Proposals include the following:

-   New Y8 (greyscale), YV411(4:1:1 planar), YV16 (4:2:2 planar), YV24
    (4:4:4 planar) formats.
-   All planes are created 16 byte address aligned and have mod 16 pitch.
-   Thread-safe avisynth.h.


AviSynth v2.61:
:::::::::::::::

This version will use the free Microsoft compiler. It will be feature
identical to 2.60 i.e. Source new syntax changes only!


AviSynth v2.6n:
:::::::::::::::

A bit further down the track as time and volunteers permit.

-   Add MaskTools to the core.
-   Official Win64 support.
-   ImageMagick support to import and export pictures (besides DevIL).


AviSynth v3:
::::::::::::

AviSynth v3.0 is a powerful frameserver for Windows and Linux, and it is a
complete rewrite of AviSynth v2.5, written from scratch by Bidoche (David
Pierre), Kurosu, Caro and others. v3.0 is not relying on vfw anymore,
although it can be used when possible. It is made in such a way, that new
APIs can be added to the core, like ffmpeg and gstreamer. Also here many new
colorformats will be added: YV24, RGB45 and YV45 which are 15 bits depth
versions of RGB24 and YV24. Direct streaming will be supported, and many
other new things. The progress can be found `here`_. The discussion takes
place at irc.freenode.org#avisynth and `here`_.
