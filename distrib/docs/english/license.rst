    Linking Avisynth statically or dynamically with other modules is
    making a
    combined work based on Avisynth.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
    the GNU
    General Public License cover the whole combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of Avisynth give you
    permission to link Avisynth with independent modules that communicate
    with Avisynth solely through the interfaces defined in avisynth.h,
    regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
    copy and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your
    choice, provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied
    by
    a complete copy of the source code of Avisynth (the version of
    Avisynth
    used to produce the combined work), being distributed under the terms
    of
    the GNU General Public License plus this exception.  An independent
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on Avisynth,
    such
    as 3rd-party filters, import and export plugins, or graphical user
    interfaces.

AviSynth documentation license
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AviSynth documentation is Copyright (C) 2002-2007 AviSynth developers and
contributors.

Starting from 5 August 2007 the following documentation is released under the
`CreativeCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License`_ (abbreviated by "CC BY-
SA 3.0", see also `full license terms`_):

-   All content of the AviSynth Wiki at avisynth.org, except the AviSynth
    Filter SDK.
-   The off-line documentation which is distributed with AviSynth itself,
    except any external plugin documentation which is copyright corresponding
    authors (see description of these plugins for their license terms).

When editing this Wiki or using material from this Wiki or off-line
documentation you are bound by the terms of this license, and these terms are
briefly as follows:

You are allowed to copy, modify or improve the content of the AviSynth Wiki
and the off-line documentation provided that:

-   Share Alike (SA): The resulting changes are licensed under the same
    or a compatible license as the AviSynth Wiki and the off-line
    documentation (which is "CC BY-SA 3.0").
-   Attribution (BY): Permit users to copy, distribute, display and
    perform the work and make derivative works based upon it only if they
    give the author or licensor the credits in the manner specified by these.
    This implies that if you distribute parts of the documentation (such as
    articles or scripts) your should refer to "AviSynth documentation Wiki"
    (or "AviSynth documentation") with link to these pages or to the main
    site: avisynth.org. You must also keep attributions for the parts
    attributed to other resources or authors.

Besides above two requirements, you also agree that:

-   attribution of your contributions will (or may) be given to AviSynth
    project in a form "AviSynth documentation" or "AviSynth documentation
    Wiki" (avisynth.org).
-   your contribution (and main Wiki content) may be relicensed by the
    AviSynth developers team under a compatible license.
-   you are also promising us that you wrote the contributions yourself,
    or copied it from public domain, or from work with a compatible license.
    DO NOT SUBMIT COPYRIGHTED WORK WITHOUT PERMISSION!

Note that this license has a fair-use clause (article 2):

*"2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws."*

which, in our opinion, explicitly permits you to post and discuss scripts
(from the documentation) where ever you want without the need to mention its
license or its authors, but it is civil to credit the developers and script
authors. Of course, you may not declare yourself as its author or distribute
the documentation under an uncompatible license.

AviSynth documentation translations to other languages (both at the wiki and
off-line) should be under same or compatible license terms.
